Test scripts using main method on Registration page in different classes:
For this, you would typically have separate classes for each test case. Here's an example:

java
Copy code
public class RegistrationTest1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test script for registration page - Test case 1
        // Write your test logic here
    }
}

public class RegistrationTest2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test script for registration page - Test case 2
        // Write your test logic here
    }
}

// And so on for other test cases
Write all the above 5 Test scripts in a single class using TestNG annotations:
java
Copy code
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class RegistrationTests {

    @Test
    public void testLoginBasic() {
        // Test logic for login using basic method
    }

    // Other test methods for different scenarios
}
Run the individual test scripts and the entire suite testing.xml:
You can run individual test scripts using TestNG from your IDE or command line. For running the entire suite, you can create an XML file (testing.xml) and configure it to include all the test classes.

Use all the TestNG annotations and run the scripts:
As demonstrated in point 2, you can use TestNG annotations like @Test, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, etc., to configure your test cases. You can run the scripts using TestNG test runner.

Separate web elements from the test scripts and maintain them in a properties file:
You can store the web elements in a properties file (e.g., elements.properties) and load them in your test scripts using Properties class in Java.

Create PageObjects class for all the page objects of an application:
Create separate classes for each page of your application. Each class will contain the web elements and methods to interact with those elements on that particular page.

Create PageActions class for all the operations that are performed on the web elements:
Create a separate class for each page (or module) and define methods for different actions that can be performed on the web elements of that page.

Create a separate Test Suite file for each Module:
Create XML files for each module and include the relevant test classes in those files.

Write 10 test scripts for each module:
Write ten test methods in each test class corresponding to each module.

Group the test cases using TestNG Groups attribute:
Use @Test(groups = "group_name") annotation to group test cases and execute them together.

Prioritize the test scripts using TestNG priority attribute:
Use @Test(priority = priority_number) annotation to prioritize the execution order of test methods.

Create a BaseTest and have common code in the BaseTest, All Test Suites should inherit the BaseTest:
Create a BaseTest class with common setup and teardown methods. Extend this class in all your test classes.

Use loggers:
Use logging libraries like Log4j or java.util.logging to log messages in your test scripts.

Create a config file and pass the constant values from the config file:
Create a properties file (e.g., config.properties) and store constant values like URLs, browser configurations, etc., and load them in your test scripts.

Know how to debug the Scripts:
Use debugging features provided by your IDE to debug the test scripts.

Run the scripts in all browsers:
Use Selenium Grid or TestNG's parallel execution feature to run tests in multiple browsers.

Parameterize the scripts using excel, Running the same script with multiple sets of test data:
Use libraries like Apache POI to read data from Excel files and parameterize your test scripts.

Parameterize the scripts using DataProvider:
Use TestNG's @DataProvider annotation to provide test data to your test methods.

Push the code in Bitbucket:
Use Git to version control your code and push it to a Bitbucket repository.

Configure extent Report:
Use Extent Reports library to generate detailed HTML reports for your test executions. You can configure it to generate reports after each test run.
